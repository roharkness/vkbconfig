# vkbconfig
My VKB configuration for a Gunfighter Mk III MCGU grip with T-Rudder Mk IV and differential braking

This configuration, built with VKB Device Config v0.92.51 (NJoy firmware v2.12.0), assumes that you want to use the bottom handle as a brake lever to activate the brakes, and that the level is assigned to axis 8 on the grip, with the rudder pedals on axis 7.

When the brake lever is pulled, the input of the lever and the rudder is combined on virtual axes 9 & 10, and those two virtual axes are mapped to a second virtual controller that should appear in your app. Axis 9 appears as the Rot X input, and Axis 10 appears as the Rot Y input.
